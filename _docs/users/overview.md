## Squiz Matrix CMS

La Trobe's Squiz Matrix CMS is already making use of the Design System - see the dcumentation here: [https://www.latrobe.edu.au/ds/ds-home](https://www.latrobe.edu.au/ds/ds-home)


## Other CMS developers, hand coded site developers, or other website products

If you want to use the DS patterns in another CMS or site:

### 1. Download the CSS and JS files from the dist folder on github and place them in your site

[https://github.com/latrobe-design-system/latrobe-design-system.github.io/tree/master/_ltu-components/dist](https://github.com/latrobe-design-system/latrobe-design-system.github.io/tree/master/_ltu-components/dist)

### 2. Use the starter template to create your page template

### 3. Refer to the pattern documentation for usage and code
